### ORID Report - Emily

#### Objective: What Did We Learn Today?
Today, we focused on learning React basics, specifically the useContext and reducer hooks, as well as the react component life-cycle. Additionally, we had a group competition where different teams presented on various design patterns, including the observer pattern, iterator pattern, state pattern, and strategy pattern. Lastly, we conducted a retrospective to reflect on our progress.

#### Reflective: My Feelings
I found today's session to be a valuable opportunity to refresh my knowledge of useContext and reducer hooks, as I haven't used them in a while. It was challenging to recall my memory, but I was able to overcome the rustiness in my memory and skills. Moreover, the presentations on different design patterns were highly informative and expanded my understanding of these concepts.

#### Interpretive: Why?
The exposure to other teams' presentations on design patterns was especially enlightening for me. During my university years, I didn't delve deeply into these subjects, so they were relatively unfamiliar to me. The explanations provided by the other teams were easy to comprehend and gave me a valuable opportunity to learn about these design patterns in a comprehensive way.

#### Direction: Action Points - What Changes Will I Make?
Moving forward, I plan to continue practicing my React skills and further explore different design patterns. There is still a lot for me to learn in both areas.
