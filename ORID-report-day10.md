### ORID Report - Emily

#### Objective: What Did We Learn Today?
Today, we covered several important topics. We learned about promises, which are essential for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. We also explored how to use Axios to fetch data from external APIs, a common task in web development. Additionally, we delved into React Router for managing navigation in single-page applications. We also spent time understanding flex-box CSS properties for creating responsive layouts and practiced using Ant Design’s pagination component to handle large datasets efficiently.

#### Reflective: My Feelings
I found today’s session really helpful for refreshing my knowledge of React Router and async functions in React. It was engaging and highlighted areas where I need more practice. I felt a mix of excitement and challenge, as it was great to revisit these concepts but also a reminder that I need to brush up on them.

#### Interpretive: Why?
During the in-class exercise, I realized that I was a bit rusty with these concepts, especially in handling asynchronous operations in React. It was a good opportunity to clarify the differences between async/await and then/catch. I also found that I wasn’t very familiar with flexbox properties, probably because I haven’t used them in a while. The mini-game was exciting and really helped me revise these concepts.

#### Direction: Action Points - What Changes Will I Make?
To improve, I will dedicate more time to practicing these concepts outside of class. I’ll work on small projects that incorporate promises, Axios, and React Router to reinforce my understanding. I will also review and practice flex-box layouts to ensure I can apply these properties correctly.
